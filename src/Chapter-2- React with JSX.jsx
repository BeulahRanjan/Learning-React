REACT WITH JSX –
==================================================
This section introduces JSX as the syntax extension used by React to describe UI elements.
It explains how JSX maps to React elements, shares practical tips and best practices,
and shows how Babel transpiles JSX into browser-compatible JavaScript.
You’ll also learn the basics of Webpack, including loaders, and apply everything by
building and bundling a simple Recipes app using a Webpack build process.
